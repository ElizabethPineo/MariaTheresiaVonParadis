# MariaTheresiaVonParadis
Description:
Encoding the works of Maria Theresia von Paradis, a Blind Classical composer, using the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), then creating .wav, .brf, and modified stave notation files from the encoded ones. The goal is to increase representation of Paradis' work, ensure its preservation, and increase accessibility of her scores for Disabled users.

Navigation:
There are 6 types of files in this repository: MSCZ, musicXML, MEI, MSN (MSN-C and MSN-B), BRF, and WAV. MSCZ is MuseScore's file format, from which the musicXML and MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) files are created. MSN (Modified Stave Notation) scores, akin to large print for text, are provided in color (MSN-C) and black and white (MSN-B). BRF (Braille Ready Format) files are Braille music notation files created from the MSCZ files; these require a Braille display to view. WAV (or WAVE) files are audio files generated from the MSCZ files.
